This diagram represents the test case that was completed to verify the gRPC communication.

```
+--------------------------------+      gRPC Call       +--------------------------------+
|                                |--------------------->|                                |
|  GrpcConnectionTest            |  (SubmitEvent)      |  ManagementServiceImpl         |
|  (JUnit test - client)         |<---------------------|  (gRPC Server - in new thread) |
|                                |   (SubmitResponse)  |                                |
+--------------------------------+                     +--------------------------------+
```

**Explanation:**

1.  The `GrpcConnectionTest` class acted as the **gRPC client**.
2.  It started the **gRPC server** (`ManagementServiceImpl`) in a separate thread.
3.  The client then sent a `SubmitEvent` request to the server.
4.  The server received the request, processed it, and sent back a `SubmitEventResponse`.

This test confirmed that the basic gRPC communication is working as expected.
