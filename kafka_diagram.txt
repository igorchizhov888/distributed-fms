This diagram illustrates the role of Apache Kafka as the central messaging bus in the Distributed Fault Management System.

| (Producer)          |      |                     |      |                     |

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Software Adapters (Producers):** These components will receive fault events from various network sources (starting with SNMP), format them into a standard model, and then publish them to a Kafka topic.

2.  **FMS Core Nodes (Consumers):** These components will subscribe to the Kafka topic to receive the fault events and then process them using the in-memory data grid and correlation logic.

This asynchronous communication through Kafka decouples the event producers from the event consumers, which is a key aspect of the system's design.
